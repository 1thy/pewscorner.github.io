<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this document formulas are derived for the Doppler shift in
various cases.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Stationary Transmitter, Moving Receiver</h2>

<p>Assume we have a medium in which waves are transmitted with a
frequency of f<sub>0</sub> and propagate with velocity v<sub>w</sub> relative
to the medium. If the wave transmitter is at rest relative to the medium, the
wavelength everywhere in the medium will be:</p>

<p>Equation 1:</p>

<p>If the receiver is moving with velocity v<sub>Rx</sub>
relative to the medium and in the direction of the transmitter, then the receiver's
velocity relative to the waves will be:</p>

<p>Equation 2:</p>

<img src="image002.svg" alt="">

<p>Thus, the received waves will have the apparent frequency:</p>

<p>Equation 3:</p>

<img src="image003.svg" alt="">

<p>By substituting Equation 1 and Equation 2 into Equation 3, we obtain the following expression for the apparent frequency:</p>

<p>Equation 4:</p>

<img src="image004.svg" alt="">

<p>This can be rewritten to express the relative Doppler shift:</p>

<p>Equation 5:</p>

<img src="image005.svg" alt="">

<p>Keep in mind that the velocities v<sub>w</sub> and v<sub>Rx</sub>
are relative to the medium.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Moving Transmitter, Stationary Receiver</h2>

<p>Now let's assume that the transmitter is moving with
velocity v<sub>Tx</sub> relative to the medium and towards the receiver, which
is at rest relative to the medium. The wavelength in front of the transmitter
will be reduced by the distance it travels during one wave period T<sub>0</sub>
(=1/f<sub>0</sub>), so the wavelength becomes:</p>

<p>Equation 6:</p>

<img src="image006.svg" alt="">

<p>The received waves will therefore have the apparent
frequency:</p>

<p>Equation 7:</p>

<img src="image007.svg" alt="">

<p>By substituting Equation 6 into Equation 7, we obtain the following expression for the apparent frequency:</p>

<p>Equation 8:</p>

<img src="image008.svg" alt="">

<p>And the relative Doppler shift becomes:</p>

<p>Equation 9:</p>

<img src="image009.svg" alt="">

<p>When v<sub>Tx</sub> is small compared to v<sub>w</sub>, Equation
8 and Equation 9 become similar to the stationary transmitter case (Equation 4 and Equation 5) as shown below:</p>

<p>Equation 10:</p>

<img src="image010.svg" alt="">

<p>Equation 11:</p>

<img src="image011.svg" alt="">

<hr>

<h2>Moving Transmitter, Moving Receiver</h2>

<p>If both the transmitter and the receiver are moving relative
to the medium and towards each other with the velocities v<sub>Tx</sub> and v<sub>Rx</sub>,
respectively, relative to the medium, then the wavelength &#955; will be
described by Equation 6, and the receiver's velocity v relative to the waves will be described by Equation 2. For the receiver the waves will therefore have the apparent frequency:</p>

<p>Equation 12:</p>

<img src="image012.svg" alt="">

<p>and the relative Doppler shift:</p>

<p>Equation 13:</p>

<img src="image013.svg" alt="">

<p>When v<sub>Rx</sub> and v<sub>Tx</sub> are small compared to v<sub>w</sub>,
these equations can be simplified to:</p>

<p>Equation 14:</p>

<img src="image014.svg" alt="">

<p>Equation 15:</p>

<img src="image015.svg" alt="">

<p>Note that v<sub>Tx</sub> and v<sub>Rx</sub> should have the
same sign when they are pointed in opposite directions. v<sub>w</sub> should always
be positive.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Electromagnetic Waves</h2>

<p>For electromagnetic waves it is not necessary to relate the
motion of the transmitter, receiver, and waves to a medium. Only the velocities
relative to the receiver are important. If the velocity v<sub>Tx</sub> of the
transmitter relative to the receiver (and towards it) is much smaller than the velocity
v<sub>w</sub> of the waves (which is 299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum), we can reuse Equation 10
and Equation 11, regardless of whether the receiver is moving or not:</p>

<p>Equation 16:</p>

<img src="image010.svg" alt="">

<p>Equation 17:</p>

<img src="image011.svg" alt="">

<p>Remember that in this case v<sub>Tx</sub> is the transmitter's velocity relative to the
<i>receiver</i> - not relative to the medium. Equation 16 and Equation 17 could of course also
be obtained by setting v<sub>Rx</sub>=0 in Equation 14 and Equation 15, respectively.</p>

<p>If the transmitter velocity v<sub>Tx</sub> is <i>not</i> small compared to the electromagnetic
wave velocity v<sub>w</sub>, relativistic effects (according to
<a href="../relativity_theory/doc.html">Einstein's Theory of Relativity</a>)
will be non-negligible and need to be taken into account. In this case,
<a href="../relativity_theory/doc.html#Time_Dilation_Derived_from_the_Lorentz_Transformation">time dilation</a>
will reduce the transmitted frequency f<sub>0</sub> in Equation 8 by the Lorentz factor &gamma;
when observed from the receiver's frame of reference (before accounting for the Doppler shift).
The Lorentz factor is determined by the transmitter's velocity v<sub>Tx</sub> relative to the
receiver as follows: </p>

<p>Equation 18:</p>

<img src="image018.svg" alt="">

<p>Replacing f<sub>0</sub> in Equation 8 with the time dilated value f<sub>0</sub>/&gamma;,
we get the combined result of time dilation and Doppler shift:</p>

<p>Equation 19:</p>

<img src="image019.svg" alt="">

<p>Equation 20:</p>

<img src="image020.svg" alt="">

<p>(v<sub>Tx</sub> is the transmitter's velocity relative to the receiver and towards the receiver,
and v<sub>w</sub> is the electromagnetic wave velocity).</p>
