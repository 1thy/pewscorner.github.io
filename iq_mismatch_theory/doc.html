<h1>I/Q Signal Mismatch Theory</h1>

<div class="box imgbox">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the impact of amplitude and phase
mismatch in an I/Q (in-phase/quadrature-phase) signal pair. The result of a mismatch is an
unwanted spectral component at the negative signal frequency.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>An ideal sinusoidal I/Q signal pair with no amplitude or
phase mismatch can be represented by the following complex function:</p>

<p>Equation 1:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">y(t) &nbsp; = &nbsp; A exp(i(&#969;t + &#966;)) &nbsp; = &nbsp;
A cos(&#969;t + &#966;) &nbsp; + &nbsp; i A sin(&#969;t + &#966;)</p>

<p>The real part (the first term in the second expression) of
y(t) is the I signal, and the imaginary part (the second term except the &quot;i&quot;)
is the Q signal. &#969;, A, and &#966; are the angular frequency, amplitude and
phase, respectively.</p>

<p>If an amplitude and phase mismatch is introduced, the
function becomes:</p>

<p>Equation 2:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">y(t) &nbsp; = &nbsp; A cos(&#969;t + &#966;) &nbsp; + &nbsp;
i &#945; A sin(&#969;t + &#966; + &#949;)</p>

<p>Here, A and &#966; are the amplitude and phase of the I
signal, &#945; is the amplitude mismatch (the ratio of Q amplitude to I
amplitude), and &#949; is the phase mismatch (the Q phase plus 90 degrees minus the I
phase). For &#945;=0 dB (&#945;=1) and &#949;=0 degrees there is no mismatch.</p>

<p>By rewriting Equation 2 we can split the mismatched I/Q signal into its spectral components:</p>

<p>Equation 3:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">y(t) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0.5 (1 + &#945; exp(i &#949;)) A exp(i(&#969;t + &#966;))
&nbsp; + &nbsp; 0.5 (1 - &#945; exp(-i &#949;)) A exp(-i(&#969;t + &#966;))</p>

<p>The first term is the wanted signal (including both I and Q
parts) - a pure complex sinusoid at the frequency &#969;. The second term is an
unwanted signal at the negative frequency -&#969;. The wanted signal is simply
the ideal I/Q signal from Equation 1 multiplied by a complex constant, which modifies the amplitude and phase (here, the I and Q parts are modified equally).</p>

<p>From Equation 3 the ratio of the unwanted signal magnitude to the wanted signal magnitude can be found:</p>

<p>Equation 4:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It has been shown that the introduction of an amplitude
and/or phase mismatch between the I and Q signals causes an unwanted spectral
component to appear at the mirror frequency. Also, the amplitude and phase of
the wanted spectral component will change. Equation 3 quantifies these effects.</p>
